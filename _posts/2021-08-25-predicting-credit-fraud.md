About a few years ago I had some fraudulent transactions made from my credit card and when I first saw them it made me confused and frustrated. I was questioning if I really made those transactions or if I recently signed up for a new subscription to something. I had to go back into my emails and look to see what I recently bought to double check. In the end, I called my bank asking about more information about the transaction and we both deemed it to be fraud. The bank took care of everything, but it was scary to think that someone was using my card to make payments and if I didn’t create the habit to go on my banking app about every week then the situation could have been worse. 

In the moment the whole situation made me feel like I couldn’t trust the stores and gas stations with making a simple transaction without being paranoid about my credit card information being stolen. Ever since then I developed a habit of going on my banking app almost every night before going to bed, making sure I cover my card keypad while entering any PIN and paying with cash at gas stations. 

Naturally a credit card fraud data set caught my eye when looking for a data set to apply a predictive model to.  


**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
